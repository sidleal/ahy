= Checkout =

You will need:
 * Jboss AS6
 * Eclipse (Helios)

After extracting Jboss AS6:
 * Copy mysql and jdom jars to <jboss_path>/common/lib.
 * Copy ahy-cms-ds.xml to <jboss_path>/server/default/deploy and edit it to check database config.

Do a checkout for each project: ahy, ahy-kernel and ahy-web.

Add a new server in Eclipse, pointing to <jboss_path>, check the target runtimes of all three projects.

On ahy-web, change the path of jsf-api.jar (project properties/build path).
