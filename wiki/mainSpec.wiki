#Main spec issues and requirement notes.

===Ahy - A Pure Java CMS===
"For those tired of 'browser wars' and suffering."

Our main goals:

 * Run on Jboss App Server.
 * Database Independence (with JPA).
 * Scalability (with EJB3).
 * No javascript allowed and no Browser specific-code.
 * Must have:
   # One pure html interface (allowing sites to be found by search engines and be accessed by old devices)
   # One rich interface, with drag n drog and everything else we deserve (JavaFX).
   # A rich admin module, extremely easy to use.
 * Custom xml-based templates/themes.


= Installation Wizzard =

On the first run, the app must check the jboss config, ask user data and write it to:
 * deploy/mail-service.xml (smtp server, port, user and passwd)
 * properties-service.xml (static config like database type)
 * ahy-cms-ds.xml (Database connection string and authentication data)

after that, the update engine will create all tables and insert sample data.
