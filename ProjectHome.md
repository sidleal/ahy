### Ahy - A Pure Java CMS ###
"For those tired of 'browser wars' and suffering."

We are just on the beginning, you are welcome to join us.

Our main goals:

  * Run on Jboss App Server.
  * Database Independence (with JPA).
  * Scalability (with EJB3).
  * No javascript allowed and no Browser specific-code.
  * Must have:
    1. One pure html interface (allowing sites to be found by search engines and be accessed by old devices)
    1. One rich interface, with drag n drog and everything else we deserve (JavaFX).
    1. A rich admin module, extremely easy to use.
  * Custom xml-based templates/themes.
